I spent a decent amount of time on this thing and I'd hate to see someone slap some ads on top of it without at least contacting (and paying) me. If you do have a way to make money off this weird little project, awesome! I want some!

Also, I've only ever used the standard MIT license, so I thought it'd be interesting to try something different.

Feel free to open an issue or contact me directly with questions.

Thanks,
